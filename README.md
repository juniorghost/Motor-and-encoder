#Encoder-RPM
Written by Salim EL Atache // Date: 21/10/2020

For this code, I tried to use an encoder as a way of measuring a small dc motor speed. I connected the encoder with the shaft of the DC motor in a special way to avoid slipping, 
and I used an OLED-SSD103 to display the speed of the motor.

Enjoy!
